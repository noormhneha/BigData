Kona is world famous for its gin-clear deep-blue waters. Kona means "lee" in Hawaiian and the region enjoys a dry, sunny climate with limited run off creating rich reefs and amazing visibility. We have some of the best diving and snorkeling in Hawaii right off our shores and steps from Surf Temple.', 'notes': 'Watching the sunset on the beach across the street is a fantastic experience! Feel free to take a snack and beverage to the beach, rest on a blanket and watch the gorgeous colors emerge.', 'transit': 'Proximity to Airports: Surf Temple is just twenty minutes (20) from Kona (KOA) Airport and 1.5 hours from Hilo Airport (ITO). Even though Kona Airport is a small, it enjoys excellent service from the mainland including nonstop flights from Denver, San Francisco, and even Tokyo. Car Rental: while a car is not strictly necessary, we recommend renting a vehicle at the airport upon arrival.  The Big Island is huge with many places to see and without a car you will miss out on great opportunities to tour the island. A Jeep or pickup can be particularly fun and good for toting boogie boards, scuba gear, and outdoor toys as well as allowing access to some of the islands more rugged areas.', 'access': "Guests will have access to the entire house!

The short review: Simply put, if this home is available, book it quickly. The location is amazing, only a few footsteps across the street you have a beautiful beach (usually we were the only ones there) with lava rocks, some white sand, and amazing snorkeling. It's so close to the ocean that you can hear waves crashing from the house. The home is beautiful inside and out, updated and designed with amazing taste. The yard is very spacious and spread out. It is also located in a perfect location to snorkeling, surfing, dining out, grocery stores, Costco, but is secluded enough away from the busier parts of Kona that our family wanted to avoid. The owners of the home are also very friendly and helpful. I can't stress enough that this place is amazing and as we completely loved our stay here and plan to return again in the future.\xa0  A more detailed review: The house and grounds are beautiful and thoughtfully decorated. We also learned that the home was recently renovated as well with new appliances in the main kitchen and new bathrooms and showers. Tile floors throughout and around the house and also on the patio areas were great. The yards have beautiful landscaping with many tropical plants and trees. The patio areas have tons of space, outdoor fans, outdoor couches where you can relax and eat your meals on a beautiful wood table. A Weber BBQ was great for cooking, and a nice addition to the home. The insides of the living areas are impeccable, beautifully designed and furnished. It made us feel as if we were living inside of an interior decorated home featured in a magazine.\xa0  The home itself is actually two structures connected by a common roof. One half of the home is a spacious living room, full kitchen including: dish washer, full sized shower, bathroom, and a beautifully decorated large bedroom with a large closet. There's a very spacious patio area just in front of its entrance as well. The second structure is a large bedroom, a kitchenette, bathroom and a newly remodeled shower. This structure also has a private patio area and separate entrance. It also has a washer and drier.  I spent a few days of my trip doing snorkeling right across the street, taking photos and videos with my GoPro, and diving at this spot and really loved it. I saw hundreds of tropical fish, cool reefs, and even a turtle. The water was very clear, too!\xa0  My family of four booked this location at the last minute for our yearly holiday vacation over Christmas and NYE. The condos that were available at the time looked okay, but this house was at another level. We'll definitely be recommending it to friends who want an amazing place to rent while staying in Hawaii.

It's on the main street that goes through downtown Kona about 4 miles south of downtown. There is a rocky beach behind the house across the street, and we could hear the ocean at night. It's about a 5 minute walk from a really nice beach that is popular with surfers and snorkelers. We didn't surf here but we did snorkel. It was a great, clear spot with lots of fish. The location is great for seeing Kona and all the great spots around it, such as Honaunau and Kealakekua Bay (with a car). Because it's on one of the main roads, there was a bit of road traffic, and the neighbors were a bit loud on Friday night, but all the great amenities made up for it. There is a very modern main house with one bedroom and a very nice kitchen, bathroom and living space, and a separate ohana (a mother-in-law suite) a few feet away with a shared patio. This would be a great place to for 2 couples so each could have some privacy. Although the ohana suite just has a kitchenette so any cooking of meals would be easier in the main house. The hosts don't live nearby so all communication was by text, but we had no problems.

The two seperate spaces provided the perfect amount of privacy for two couples while still having a good common gathering space on the shared lanai. Both the ohana and main house were beautifully decorated and cozy. Both beds were so comfortable and the bedding felt soft and luxurious. The home is a very quick drive into the main shopping area while still being far enough away to feel less touristy and congested. It's also close to many coffee farms, manta ray dives, the Painted Church, and Kealakekua bay. The beach across the street is lovely to watch the water but a five minute walk down the road leads to another beach for surfing and snorkeling. It's rocky, but the water was very clear and full of brightly-colored reef fish and sea turtles. It was so nice to have in easy walking distance. I would recommend this home to anyone and everyone.

It is such a gem. \n\nThe house is beautiful, perfectly clean, and appointed with everything we needed. We had a wonderful time cooking meals in the open kitchen and eating on the big lanai table. The front yard is filled with Plumaria trees which made our entire stay smell like we were staying in a spa. My partner and I loved the big master shower (big enough for two!), and we both thought the master bed was the comfiest bed we've ever slept in. Both of us have back pain at times, and this bed was perfect as it was very soft but still supportive. The cool cross-breeze from the open windows (with screens) helped us both sleep very well.\n\nSurfTemple had a unique advantage because it essentially is two separate cottages, each with its own master suite, connected by a shared patio. Our friends stayed in the smaller master suite and had a great time. It was nice to be able to go somewhere with friends and feel that we were connected and staying together, but we also each had our own privacy. The smaller suite also has its own little kitchen, convenient for midnight snacks.\n\nWe really enjoyed staying in the area. We swam with turtles in Kalahu'u Bay, just a two-minute walk down the road. It was a blast. We also enjoyed hanging out in the very nearby downtown Kona area and trying out the restaurants. We scuba dived with Jack's Diving Locker at the recommendation of our hosts and had a blast!  We also tried Gypsea Gelato at their recommendation and it was amazing!!  Highly recommended. \n\nWe found SurfTemple to be very well located in the area. There are grocery stores and all of the essentials very close by, and there is easy access to Kona and the tourist destinations. \n\nWe very much enjoyed walking to the public beach access that is directly across the street from SurfTemple and watching the sunset every night. It is great to have the ocean so close! It felt like we had our own private beach right across the road. \n\nWe loved our time and can't wait to return! \n\nRebecca and Mattias "}, {'_id': '154951518', 'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 5, 26, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '16253247', 'reviewer_id': '65547003', 'reviewer_name': 'Ingibjörg', 'comments': 'I stayed at SurfTemple with my family for a few nights.

Cuenta con todo lo que hace falta para tener una estancia perfecta. No nos faltó de nada. Además, está muy bien comunicado y dispone de establecimientos de todo tipo bastante cercanos.\r\nEn resumen, bastante recomendable para pasar unas vacaciones perfectas en Nueva York. De 10. \r\n-----\r\nEverything was perfect. From arrival at the house, Sol was a great hostess. We were greeted warmly and explained everything about the house and communications with Manhattan. We also left some things to eat, which is appreciated well after a long journey. He also took care of us during the trip to see how we were.\r\nAs for accommodation, needless to say much more than what it says in the ad. It is quite true to the photos. It has everything needed for a perfect stay. We did not want for anything. It is also very well connected and has all kinds of establishments close enough.\r\nIn short, highly recommended for a perfect holiday in New York.

It's definitely more of your quiet, residential neighborhood, very appropriate for families since I was traveling with my toddler in tow. Stores and fast food restaurants are within half a mile walking distance. Not far at all. I rented a car so this location was great because there was plenty of parking! It was also the midpoint of JFK Airport and Woodside Queens where I drove to most of the time. If you're looking for a place closer to the city with easy access to subway stations then this property will not serve you well. You'll need to take a bus to subway station. \n\nApartment has its own entrance through the back which is great! On a nice day you can have a picnic outside on the yard or just relax to reset your mind from all the NYC craziness. :-) The property does offer a cozy and warmth feeling. It is also not cluttered with any of the owner's belongings like some Airbnb properties are (Airbnb advises hosts to stow away belongings for safety reasons). The apartment is equipped with a full size bed I believe if I'm not mistaken, free wifi and cable tv. Apartment does not have a full kitchen BUT it does have a full size refrigerator and microwave....AND a washer/dryer! Loved it and used it. We went home with clean clothes and no laundry to wash! \n\nI had a late check in and Sol was very accommodating with this. She even assisted me with my luggage and tried to console my crying 3 year old boy to make him feel more comfortable. Any questions I had, Sol was quick to respond back. She was easy to get a hold of and a pleasure to speak with all the time! She is a great host and will go the extra mile to make your stay as comfy and safe as possible.

This was our first air b&b experience and we were hoping very much that it would be as the reviews and the photos.\n\nPros:  Location close to our activities (Website hidden by Airbnb) Street parking was fairly easy to find (Website hidden by Airbnb) Neighborhood quiet (Website hidden by Airbnb) Washer & Drye (Website hidden by Airbnb) Sol was kind enough to accommodate us with an early check-in.\n\nCons: Unfortunately we were unable to rest after a long overnight flight because of all the noise from upstairs.   All the walking back and forth felt like someone was trampling on our heads.  During our five day stay we did not rest properly at all because of the noise from lengthy phone conversations and general activities upstairs.  \n\nThe bed was uncomfortable.  Every time one of us moved it squeaked very loudly.  There were no nightstands.  I slept on the right side and there was no place to put a bottle of water or a box of tissues.  I kept hitting my elbow on the shelving unit at the side of the bed.  The layout of the apartment was not very convenient.  We were unable to watch TV because of the location of the TV.  The two lawn type chairs in front of the TV were difficult to sit down on and get out of.  The only mirror for getting dressed was in front of the bed.  The only table to layout make-up etc was away from the mirror.  We had to keep walking back and forth to get dressed.\n\nHousekeeping notes:  It was a basement apt.  Although it was listed as having air-conditioning, there was NO air-conditioning.  There was a fan that was adequate but had to be kept on constantly.  Bathroom was miniscule.  The seal at the bottom of the shower was discolored.  The vent in the ceiling of the bathroom was full of dust.  The mirror in the bedroom needed repair.  The molding at the bottom right of the mirror was broken.  The ironing board cover needs replacing.  There was a huge burnt hole on the cover.  I had to get a t-shirt to cover the hole so that I could iron our clothes.\n\nPersonal Preferences:  I would have liked a bin to put our recyclables.  I would have also liked a box of tissues to be available.\n\nAir B&B says to remember this is a person’s home not a hotel.  While I realize that it is a person’s home, that person, the Air B&B host is utilizing their home as a business, by charging a premium for guests to use their home in lieu of a hotel room.  In lieu of paying a premium, the guest should expect to receive certain basic expectations , like an adequate layout, a nightstand, a clean vent in the bathroom, bathroom sealant that is not discolored a comfortable chair to sit on, and a comfortable bed.  To be honest I felt rather let down by all the reviews.  \n'}, {'_id': '163138626', 'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 23, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '4430808', 'reviewer_id': '6145447', 'reviewer_name': 'Melissa', 'comments': "Sol and Izak were the perfect hosts.

We had an amazing stay. Brook's property manager, Sarah emailed us directions and pictures of the front gate to the property prior to our arrival. This was immensely helpful to us as we arrived in Hana after dark. Upon arrival, we found the cottage to be clean and roomy. The king sized bed was very comfortable. We miss having a king size bed in our own condo and it was definitely nice to be able to spread out to sleep. The towels in the bathroom was amazingly soft and luxurious. It was a welcome surprise and made our stay seem super high end. In the kitchen, there's a helpful binder full of tips on house rules, area restaurants and things to do. We really enjoyed picking up local groceries and making our breakfast in the kitchen each morning. \n\nSome things to note: There's no shoes allowed inside the cottage. I felt that this helped us keep the house clean throughout our stay so I didn't mind. In the mornings, the dogs in the neighborhood bark loudly so make sure you get a good night's sleep and start your day early! We are normally not morning people but we found that our day time adventures tired us out enough to get us to bed early. It was also more important for us to get up earlier to have enough day light to explore all of Hana's natural beauty. \n\nOne major thing that bothered us was the wifi. The connection was pretty spotty. We were able to get the best connection in the living/dining room area which was surprising since the modem was located in the bedroom. It would have been nice to have a more stable connection as we had no cell signal in Hana. For reference, we have T-Mobile. (Pro Tip: download the Gypse Maui tour phone app before you start the Road to Hana. This provides location based audio tour for the drive and works without data. The entire Maui tour is $10. We got the Road to Hana only tour for $5 and bought the Maui tour after since we liked it so much.) ."}, {'_id': '223132816', 'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 31, 5, 0), 'listing_id': '8764966', 'reviewer_id': '158762436', 'reviewer_name': 'Nelson', 'comments': 'Great place to stay in Hana.

Only three minutes from subway, many grocery stores around (they are small but have good stuff).\nThe place is a bit dark, because it is on the ground floor, but for us it wasn't a problem. \nThe bottom line - highly recommend Ashley's apartment for staying in NYC!"}, {'_id': '208922509', 'date': datetime.datetime(2017, 11, 3, 4, 0), 'listing_id': '9310959', 'reviewer_id': '139232879', 'reviewer_name': 'Shiv', 'comments': 'Ashley’s place is great for both short and long term stay.

The place was very nice with great amenities. It was private and had a yard around it you could enjoy (along with a lava tube in the back!). Our 8 year old really enjoyed looking around for Geckos and playing around the lava tube. It also had a nice covered lanai with relaxing seats, a hammock, an outdoor bar/sink, and a good sized grill. Inside was very nice and clean and had all the amenities we could want. We felt like we were staying at home here. Fans in every room with remote controls so you had the controls anywhere you needed. The things they had here were great quality (pots/pans, oven, washer/dryer,shower, tv/cable, etc.) and not cheap like other places we stayed at. I thought the location was going to be an issue because it was outside of Hilo, but I was actually happy we stayed here because it was more central to the different places we were exploring while on the Hilo side. The house shares a driveway with the Host’s parents house, who were so nice and informative about different places to explore while here. Even tho you share a driveway, you still have complete privacy so don’t worry about that. Overall we give it two big thumbs up.

Opal cards can be purchased from a convenience store at the station. We also downloaded the "Opal Travel" app to check on the train times and fare estimate.

Stocked with all the essentials as if you were at home. We were welcomed with fresh bread, milk, fruit, chocolates and a bottle of bubbles for new years eve. This made such a welcome sight after having been travelling for the previous ten days and really couldn't be face the shops that late in the warmth of the afternoon.\n\nThe bedroom was appointed with plush linen, mountains of pillows to dissolve into, the design features, really made you feel like you have just stepped into a double page spread of an interior design magazine.\n\nAfter a weeks stay in the leafy suburb of Kingsgrove, we are leaving now as if we are new friends of the family.\n\nThank you for all the 'plus ones' George and Lucia, they have not gone unnoticed, and your family has really gone above and beyond what we thought was required.\n\nAs first time Air BnB users, you really have set the bar ridiculously high!\n\nWe look forward to coming back to Sydney to catch up again!

Never seen an airbnb with so much attention to detail.\n\nA few other things to note:\n\n-Beautiful decor and interior design. Pictures do not do it justice.\n\n-AC/aircon is ice cold and does a great job in the Sydney summer\n\n-There's a small, intimate patio outside with seating and a deck.\n\n-internet has strong signal though Australia's 4g/lte is so fast most of the time cell phone tethering is actually faster. I got speeds of around 5mbps.\n\n-Towels are high-end hotel quality. Very soft and fluffy.\n\n-Washer  in unit! Very nice one at that.

It\'s 1 min walking distance along with other little stores and restaurants.  If your a coffee drinker,  "Caffelinni" is 3 mins away walking which we enjoyed.  Free parking (in the back) was a huge plus since parking in Montreal can get pricy.    That alone adds a lot of value to the overall cost of the place.
